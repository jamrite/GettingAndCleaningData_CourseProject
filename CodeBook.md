This Code Book describes the data in TidyData.txt - the tidy data file generated by run_analysis.R
The file is saved as a tab-separated data with 180 rows and 81 columns. Data contains Headers.

The data is organized by Subjects 1 through 30 in the study described here (column 1): http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

columns 3 through 81 represent the values of various readings obtained from an accelerometer and gryocope, averaged over a particular type of activity, performed by a particular subject under observation.

column 2 represents the activities recorded for each subject. Activites are classified into "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING".

The table represents upto 6 activities of 30 test subjects to give 180 rows of observations.

The columns are as follows

"Subjects" - int (values from 1 to 30)
"Activities" - factor (with 6 levels - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS...)

Vectors of numerics for averaged values of Accelerometer and Gyroscope data
